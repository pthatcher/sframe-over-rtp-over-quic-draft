1.  Introduction

   RTP over QUIC [I-D.draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic-01] describes how
   to send and received real-time media over QUIC.

   SFrame [I-D.draft-ietf-sframe-enc-00] describes how to encrypt a
   media frame such that media servers (such as SFUs) have access to
   certain metadata, but not to the media.

   This document describes how to send SFrame over RTP over QUIC while
   maintaining support for the encryption properties supported by SFrame
   and the RTP topologies supported by RTP over QUIC.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  How to combine SFrame and RTP over QUIC

   To send SFrame [I-D.draft-ietf-sframe-enc-00] over RTP over QUIC
   [I-D.draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic-01] using reliable QUIC streams
   ([I-D.draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic-01] Section 6.1), one SFrame
   is sent over one QUIC stream.  When sending with unreliable datagrams
   ([I-D.draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic-01] Section 6.2), the SFrame
   payload must be packetized before sending as described in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-sframe-enc-00] Section 4.

4.  Supported RTP Topologies

   [I-D.draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic-01] Section 4.1 describes the
   RTP topologies supported RTP over QUIC and the use of RTP
   translators.  Notably, translation from from larger RTP packets (such
   as those sent over QUIC streams) to smaller RTP packets (such as
   those sent over UDP) is supported, and thus is also supported when
   sending SFrame over RTP over QUIC.  In this case, according to
   Section 4.1, "Such a translator may need codec-specific knowledge to
   packetize the payload of the incoming RTP packets in smaller RTP
   packets."

   Because SFrame encrypts the media contained in it, the only "codec-
   specific knowedge" a translator can get to when using SFrame is that
   of SFrame itself.  In effect, SFrame is the codec, and the transator
   must know how to packetize SFrame.

5.  SFrame Packetization

   [I-D.draft-ietf-sframe-enc-00] refers to a "generic RTP packetizer",
   but the format for that packetization is not defined.  So for
   purposes of translating from SFrame over RTP over QUIC to SFrame over
   RTP over UDP, we define an SFrame packetization here.

   When translating from one large RTP packet to many small RTP packets
   (such as a QUIC stream containing an SFrame to many RTP packets over
   UDP), the following format MAY be used:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  large sequence number        |   chunk index                 |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                  large payload chunk                          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   When using this format, the translator MUST construct small RTP
   packets such that they may be translated back into a large RTP packet
   using the following steps:

   1.  The large RTP packet's payload is reconstructed by concatenating
       the large payload chunks of all the small RTP packets that share
       a large sequence number in the order of the chunk indexes
       beginning from index 0 until the smaller RTP packet marked with
       the marker bit (indicating "last chunk").

   2.  The large RTP header is reconstructed by copying the RTP header
       of the small RTP packet with chunk index 0 and replacing the
       sequence number with the large sequence number.

   To be explicit, a translator using this format to translate from a
   large RTP packet to small RTP packets MUST:

   1.  Set the large sequence number in all of the small RTP packets to
       the sequence number of the large RTP packet.

   2.  Set the chunk index of the first small RTP packet to 0.

   3.  Set the chunk index to consectutive values for consecutive large
       payload chunks.

   4.  Unset (set to 0) the marker bit for all but the last small RTP
       packet.

   5.  Set the marker bit for the last small RTP packet.

5.1.  Tradeoffs

   It may be possible to save 1 byte by deriving the chunk index from
   the smaller RTP packet's sequence number and a bit somewhere that
   means "this is the first chunk", but that would come at the cost of
   additional complexity and reduced flexibility.  This format
   simplifies packet reconstruction when chunks arrive out of order, and
   allows for more flexibility in translation.  For example, if a
   translator wanted to translate from smaller packets to larger packets
   but received chunk indexes 1 and 2 before chunk index 0, it could
   begin forwarding 1 and 2 in one QUIC stream while waiting for index
   0.  It wouldn't have to wait for the first chunk of a frame before
   forwarding subsequent chunks.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document is subject to the security considerations of SFrame
   [I-D.draft-ietf-sframe-enc-00] and RTP over QUIC
   [I-D.draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic-01].
